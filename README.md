# Design_a_Tribute_Page_using_HTML_and_CSS

A tribute page is an overview of someone whom we admire in our life. In this article, we are creating a tribute 
webpage of the Late Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani using HTML and CSS. The page features a clean and visually appealing 
design, incorporating a header with a centered title, a main section with content including text and images, and 
a footer for additional information or credits.

Approach:

-> In the <body> element, we will give the title of the page using the h1 tag after that we will add an image 
of him in the img tag with some caption. We will create another div tag and write all the contents (using p tags).

-> We have also given an ID for each tag so that we can beautify the design using the respective ID in the CSS file.

-> In the CSS section, we have maintained a central design and used box-shadow to create a box effect around the main content.

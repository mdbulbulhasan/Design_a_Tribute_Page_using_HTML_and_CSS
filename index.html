            Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, often shortened
            as Maulana Bhashani, was a Bengali Politician.
            Maulana Bhashani was popularly known by  the honorary
            title Mozlum Jananeta meaning leader of the oppressed
            for his lifelong stance advocating for the poor.
            He is considered as one of the main pillars of 
            Bangladeshi independence of 1971.

                About the Legend
            </h1>
            <p>
                ☛ Mohammad Abdul Hamid Khan was born at Dhangara,
                a village in the Sirajganj mahakuma 
                (lit. 'a subdistrict') of the Pabna district 
                in Bengal, British India (present-day Sirajganj 
                District in Bangladesh), to Hajji Mohammad 
                Sharafat Khan and Mazirannesa Bibi in a Bengali 
                Muslim family.
                <br>
                ☛ Following independence, Bhashani wanted to 
                play the role of a responsible opposition.
                [citation needed] The progressive forces quickly 
                gathered around him and strengthened the National
                Awami Party with Kazi Zafar Ahmed as its General
                Secretary. But soon factional differences among 
                the progressive forces emerged and weakened 
                Bhashani's position.
                <br>
                ☛ Bhashani was highly critical of the 
                authoritarian style of the Awami League and 
                BAKSAL government.[35] He also warned Sheikh 
                Mujibur Rahman against the ever-rising corruption
                and political chaos in his own government 
                happening unbeknownst to him. Bhashani was 
                deeply shocked at the killing of Mujib, 
                for whom he had a lot of fatherly affection 
                and his family members. The person who conveyed 
                the news of Mujib's demise described how 
                Bhashani cried and then went to his prayer 
                room to offer prayer.
                <br>
                ☛ In the early 1950s, he felt that an integrated 
                Pakistan was no longer maintainable due to the 
                hegemony of West Pakistan. At the Kagmari 
                Conference, he bade farewell to West Pakistan 
                by saying As-salamu alaykum which soon became 
                a reference quote.[28] He declined to participate 
                in the national election of 1970 saying that it 
                would only help perpetuate rule by West Pakistan. 
                From 1969 his favourite slogans were Swadhin 
                Bangla Zindabad and Azad Bangla Zindabad. His 
                dream of an independent Bengal came true when 
                Bangladesh was established as an independent 
                nation-state in 1971. He advocated for the 
                separation of State and religion. He was a 
                pious Muslim who was in favour of socialism. 
                He spoke out against Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami 
                and its politics.
                <br><br>
                ☛ <b>Bhashani</b> is regarded as the proponent of 
                anti-imperialist, non-communal and left-leaning 
                politics by his admirers in present-day 
                Bangladesh and beyond.[45][46] In 2013, the 
                Awami League Government of Bangladesh reduced 
                his presence in school curricula.[47] In 2004, 
                Bhashani was ranked number 8 in BBC's poll of
                the Greatest Bengali of all time
